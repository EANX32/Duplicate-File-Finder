# Duplicate-File-Finder
This powershell script performs a hash of every file in a selected folder (recursively). The script records the file and its hash in an excel document in a location of the users choosing. The script removes any files from the record unless it finds another file with the same hash, thus only files with one or more duplicates are recorded in the excel document.
